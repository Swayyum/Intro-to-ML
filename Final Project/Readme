This study presents a comprehensive approach to kidney disease classification using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging a substantial dataset of computed tomography (CT) images, we explore the potential of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in accurately identifying various kidney conditions such as cysts, tumors, stones, and normal cases. The dataset, sourced from multiple hospitals, comprises 12,446 images, each verified by medical professionals. Through meticulous preprocessing and augmentation, we tailored the images for optimal model training, ensuring robustness and accuracy in real-world applications. Our work highlights the significant impact of machine learning in medical imaging, notably in enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. We also delve into predictive analytics, exploring the models' ability to forecast patient outcomes and guide treatment strategies. Furthermore, our findings underscore the potential for cost reductions in healthcare through automated and precise diagnostic processes. This research contributes to the evolving field of automated medical image analysis, demonstrating the transformative role of machine learning in healthcare diagnostics.
